\title{Computes the factorization of an integer \eqn{n} by Fermat's factorization
method.}
\usage{
fermat_factor(n)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer to be factored into product of smaller integers.}
}
\value{
vector of length two containing factors of integers
}
\description{
Fermat's factorization theorem redefines a composite number \eqn{n} as the
difference of squares: \deqn{n = a^2 - b^2} Which can also be written as:
\deqn{n = (a + b)(a - b)}
}
\examples{
fermat_factor(9)
fermat_factor(30)
}
