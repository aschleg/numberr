\title{Computes the factorization of an integer \eqn{n} by Fermat's factorization
method.}
\usage{
factor.fermat(n)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer to be factored into product of smaller integers.}
}
\description{
Fermat's factorization theorem redefines a composite number \eqn{n} as the
difference of squares: \deqn{n = a^2 - b^2} Which can also be written as:
\deqn{n = (a + b)(a - b)}
}
\examples{
factor.fermat(9)
factor.fermat(13742)
factor.fermat(17)
